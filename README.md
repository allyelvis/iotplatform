To create a Java Node.js code for a light switcher controlled by voice, you can follow the steps below:

1. **Setting Up Your Environment**:
   - Install Node.js on your system if you haven't already.
   - Set up a Java application that can communicate with your IoT device to control the light.

2. **Install Required Node.js Packages**:
   - Install the necessary Node.js packages for voice recognition and communication with your Java application. You can use packages like `say`, `speech-to-text`, or `node-java`.

3. **Create a Node.js Script**:
   - Write a Node.js script that listens for voice commands to control the light switch.
   - Use a library like `speech-to-text` to convert voice commands to text.
   - Implement logic to recognize specific commands related to turning the light on or off.

4. **Communication with Java Application**:
   - Use a communication protocol (e.g., REST API, MQTT) to send commands from your Node.js script to the Java application that controls the light switch.

5. **Java Application**:
   - Develop a Java application that receives commands from the Node.js script and interacts with the IoT device to turn the light on or off.
   - Implement the necessary logic to control the light switch based on the commands received from the Node.js script.

Here's a basic example to illustrate the concept:

Node.js Script (`lightSwitcher.js`):

```javascript
const { spawn } = require('child_process');
const SpeechToText = require('speech-to-text');

const listener = new SpeechToText.Listener();

listener.startListening();
listener.on('data', (data) => {
  const command = data.text.toLowerCase();
  console.log('Command:', command);

  if (command.includes('turn on')) {
    // Send a command to the Java application to turn the light on
    const javaProcess = spawn('java', ['LightSwitcher', 'on']);
  } else if (command.includes('turn off')) {
    // Send a command to the Java application to turn the light off
    const javaProcess = spawn('java', ['LightSwitcher', 'off']);
  }
});
```

Java Application (`LightSwitcher.java`):

```java
public class LightSwitcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String command = args[0];
        
        if (command.equals("on")) {
            System.out.println("Turning the light on...");
            // Implement logic to turn the light on
        } else if (command.equals("off")) {
            System.out.println("Turning the light off...");
            // Implement logic to turn the light off
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid command");
        }
    }
}
```

Please note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to adapt and expand the code based on your specific requirements and the technologies you choose to use. Additionally, you may need to consider error handling, security aspects, and scalability as you develop your complete solution.
